I like to share what I have been reading/watching/listening to keep me motivated. I also have a [Goodreads account](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35673810-phuong), which I have not been updating. Publications that I especially loved are marked with an asterisk. My all-time favorite is marked with double asterisk.
