I have had a new year resolution every single year (including 2020). It has become a fun ritual to dream about what I want to change in the new year, just to fail miserably halfway through. Every single time, the mission aborted because of the same reason - I have been and will be very indisciplined and lazy. However, it must be a somewhat ubiquitous problem. Many authors have offered advice on how to form good habits and stick to them. Myriad apps, through various approaches, from journaling to psychology therapy, have found this a rich market. Nonetheless, none of these methods works (or at least works better) than the old writing-down-what-you-want-to-do. However, throughout years of trials and errors, I have learnt a lesson or two about setting goals and forming habit. So here it goes, my resolution for 2021.

# Read one book every month (total of 12 books)

One thing I learnt about setting goal is to have a quantifiable and hard-end roadmap. Instead of "2 more books this year" or "12 books this year", "one book every month" satisfies the following criteria:

* Quantifiable: one/month (or 12 in total)
* Hard-end: At the end of the month, I will have to finish one new book
* Roadmap: Start from Jan to Dec with 12 touchpoints

Moreover, this goal is not too easy or too hard (depending on the person, I have found that I can reasonably finish one book a month given my 60-70 hours work week), thus it is challenging enough to accomplish. I also tried to pick a few books to start but let myself skip any of those if I don't feel like it. Trying to finish a book you don't like just for the sake of completion is a total waste of time.

# Spend at least 30 minutes on physical activity a day

Similar to the book-reading challenge, this goal is quantifiable and hard-end. Before 2020, I never had to set such a goal. I used to be able to workout in the gym in my door, or walk about 1 hour every day to classes. However, the pandemic and long-hour sitting at work make it so difficult to have just 30 minutes for physical activity. Activities like walking when the sun is out seem unattainable most work days. To make this goal more realistic (and to account for days that I absolutely don't have anytime for myself - even to take a shower), I have ranked the physical activities by feasibility:

* Walk/power walk/run during the 9am - 4pm ET hours (when the sun is out)
* Walk/power walk/run at late night along my terrace 
* Abs exercises
* Yoga
* Stretches
* Stand at my desk (still thinking if the balance board worths the hefty price ðŸ˜“)

Since I get tired (and bored) easily, 30-minute/day is the total time spent on any of these activities. Not bad, right?

# Get at least 150XP of Korean lessons on Duolingo

I need to really double down on learning Korean. Last year I have seen my $60 subscription went to waste because I gave up on my lessons during the last two months. My goal was simply too hard. I was forcing myself to get at least 20XP per day. To be honest, my previous project was a living hell. There are days that I cannot breathe or go to sleep because of stress, let alone studying a new language! Fed up with my progress, I let it slip - didn't even bother making up for my missing lessons on the weekends. 

This time, I want to try a different approach. I know that I cannot maintain the strikes (the number of consecutive days that I make progress on the app). I also learnt that the most effective time for learning would be the weekend, given I had a proper [blackout](https://phuongpm241.github.io/personal/blackout/) on Friday night. This goal has been working for me so far and I can tell that I am making progress. My Korean pronunciation and vocabulary got so much better!

# Eat more mindfully 

I have always had a love-hate relationship with food. There would be months that I simply hate food or the act of eating because of work-related or weight-related stress. That period is typically followed by an overeating period, when I would crave for anything and eat voraciously without noticing. Toward the end of last year, I read a book that changed my relationship with food completely - Eat what you love, love what you eat by Michelle May. I realized what I was experiencing was a cycle of restrictive-eating and over-eating. To really enjoy my food, I need to let my body regulate the act of eating. That means eating when hungry and in moderation. Ever since I tried to be more connected to my stomach (although sometimes failed because I simply wanted that pack of chips when watching K-drama), I have seen myself crave less sugar (even when I was on period) and fat. I purposedly eat more green and fruits, knowing that I can have chicken wings or fries or ice cream whenever I want. I also tried to eat more lean meat or fish, as well as drink more water. Although I have yet to lose weight, I feel less bloated and my skin gets so much better!

# Stop excessive worrying

I have been struggling with anxiety for perhaps my entire life. Combating with stress is not always easy. Sometimes, putting things off and being a little patient while complicated things resolve themselves turn out to be the best strategy. I have practiced asking myself that question "Can I do anything about the thing that makes me worry?" whenever my heart rate is above 90. Then, no matter what the answer might be I will get some down time - having chamomile tea/going on a walk/lying down with my eyes closed for 15 minutes. Once my mind becomes clearer, if the answer is yes, I will work on the matters. If it is no, I simply work on something else. I gradually learnt that worrying simply does not help in any scenarios. So why bother raising my heart rate and blood pressure and decreasing a few hours of my lifetime for nothing?

<i>I do not hope to accomplish all of my goal this year. Keeping my hope up generally gives me more disappointment. As long as me of today is better than me of yesterday, that is a success. </i>
