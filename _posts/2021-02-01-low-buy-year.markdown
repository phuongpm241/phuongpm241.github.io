This year I will also commit to these 5 low-buy rules. Although I am not really a shopaholic (in fact I might be a minimalist), there are several categories which I spend quite some time and money shopping. Many items I got from these unplanned shopping "trips" barely got used. As I am moving toward a capsule life, I am determined to reduce the amount of stuffs I acquire to bare minimal. In this post, I am also experimenting a different writing method. I plan to have a dialogue with myself, during which I learn more about my motivation and preferences. 

<b> How much is bare minimal? </b>

Everyone has a different definition of bare minimal. As for me, it means having enough stuffs to function through my day knowing I will have all the support I need. 

<b> What are my areas of improvement? </b>

Clothes, skincare products,books, and food (oh Costco ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è)

<b> Why am I setting my low buy goal? </b>

I realized there are many items that I have never used. Whenever I find something that hasn't seen light for a long time, I make myself promise to never buy such items again. It is also very irritating to force myself using these items just because I bought them. It makes owning such things stressful, which is the exact opposite of what I had in mind when I made the purchases. 

On top of that - I moved very frequently. I haven't found a place to call home yet so I will continue to move in the future. Having less stuffs definitely made the move less stressful and arduous. 

<b> What are my rules? </b>

There is no rule fit all for each of the categories that I am trying to improve. However, the overall goal is to make mindful purchase that will make me excited to use and continue using for years to come. There are several specific rules for each category, which I will revisit and improve as the year progresses.

<i>1. Clothes</i>

My biggest problem regarding clothes purchases is that I do not yet have a personal style - a capsule wardrobe that I can start building around. Therefore, it is even more important to stop my purchases and work with what I already have to define my personal style. This year is definitely convenient for that goal because we are mostly likely to stay at home and social distance for a long time. On top of that, I also plan to lose some weights, which has been another personal goal since ... forever. 

This category also has the most never-been-used items. Therefore, I plan to make smarter purchase (that is not driven by promotion) by making a wishlist and do careful "research" before buying any new items. Keeping an item in my wishlist for a long time will also help me determine if that item will really fit into my personal style or if it is a ephemeral trend. Another trick I will try to use more often is to shop second-hand for an item that I always want to add into my wardrobe. Experimenting with the thrifted items (usually get a good deal) will help me understand my personal style better.

<i>2. Books</i>

I used books as both reading and decorative materials. As a result, I only buy books which I need to take notes on/will read again. For those that I want to read but will not read again (fiction), I borrow from local library (Boston Public Library in my case). Sometimes they will have an e-book format, which is super convenient. 

<i>3. Skincare</i>

I have been improving in this category overtime. I have stopped buying stuffs for the brands/packaging. Instead, I consume products knowing exactly which ingredients are useful for my skin. I think I have narrowed my skincare routine down to "almost" bare minimal. Therefore, for 2021, purchases that I will make toward skincare will be only replacement (if I use up any products). 

<i>4. Food </i>

I love food (who doesn't?). However, there are many food items that have sit in my fridge for so long, which I buy during a Costco weekly sale. I have recently realized how much those items have contributed to my enduring problems with weight gain. These items force me to consume more food than I need. Same problem happens when I order take-out. 

My goal for this category will be to make sure I don't over order food, whether it is Costco or take-out. For Costco, I have set a maximum budget per order of 60$. I will continue to remind myself that I can make the next order whenever I want, so there is no need to add this extra box of udon to my cart. Same rule applies to take-out. I can always order take-out food whenever I feel like it, so there is no need to over order this time (also, take-out food tastes significantly worse the next day). 

<b> Finally </b>

No rules are perfect. There are many times when I feel like I MUST have these and buy them without being mindful about my rules. However, I will try to follow the rules as much as I can - move the items to my wish list instead of shopping cart for at least 80% of the time.
