As suggested by the ED of my team, I have started to write these reflections on things I have learned at work every Friday. Below are what I have learnt during the week of 04/12/2021.

1. Early alignment is very important! (i.e., asking for help to prioritize/clarification - overcommunication is never enough)

I can't stress enough how useful it is to have early alignment among key stakeholders before actually doing the work. At the beginning of this study, each team member has gone through a ton of rework because of the lack of alignment and priority. However, it is important to acknowledge that we always have a lot to do! Sometimes, leadership wouldn't notice that you are having a priority/workload problem if you don't tell them. I have learnt that I could get most of the help I need by simply asking (e.g., I think that X will take a lot of time because of A B C. I need you to be in this meeting because I foresee these X Y Z difficulties with the clients.)

2. Don't overcomplicate your thinking process! (i.e., get the process straight before you execute it)

The way leadership at my Firm think about problems/solutions is INCREDIBLY LINEAR. They follow a strict step-by-step, one-step-at-a-time thinking process that becomes immediately obvious when they tell you, but somehow I have a hard time coming up with that process myself. One reason is that these problem-solving approaches come with time and experience. However, a more important reason is that I often let my curiosity/entangled creativity drives my thinking process. Then, I would fall into the trap of seeking evidences to prove my thinking process, which is very dangerous. I would emphasize obstacles in one approach but fail to recognize problems in the others.

3. Get to the so-whats!

My communication is terrible. Let's get this straight. Although fully aware of the pyramid communication method, I still start my answer with description of the process - the nitty-gritty details of how things work. My EM often has to synthesize my emails/verbal communications to get the answer they need. I have become very self-conscious of my communication approach and am actively trying to fix it. However, I haven't come across a very tactical solution. One thing that I have been doing is to at least writing down a meeting agenda for meetings with clients that I lead. Getting at least bullet points of what I need to say have given me more confidence, although I still speak with a super high-pitch voice!
