I'm currently a data science analyst at McKinsey (Operation Analytics). Prior to McKinsey, I majored in Computer Science and Molecular Biology at MIT (S.B 2019, M.Eng 2020). I was advised by [Prof. Peter Szolovits](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/medg/people/psz/home/Pete_MEDG_site/Home.html) in the [CSAIL Clinical Decision Making Group](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/medg/). My master thesis focused on the application of Transformer NLP models on question-answering tasks on clinical reports. I was also a teaching assistant for 6.036 Introduction to Machine Learning (Fall 2019 & Spring 2020). 

I am interested in story-telling with data. In my free time, I enjoy reading, cooking, and running. My favorite journals are the Wall Street Journal and the Harvard Business Review. My [reading list]() also contains the books that I have been reading.
