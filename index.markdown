<i>When I was a teenager, I really loved the Yahoo 360 Blog platform because it allowed users to have their "online homes" in one place. It helped people connect to each other without sacrificing personal privacy. It also allowed them to demonstrate their own uniqueness with different personal designs. Well, that is all history now. Despite being a technology enthusiast, I absolutely loved the concept of Yahoo 360 Blog. I created this personal website, my one and only digital footprint, where I document my journey as a tiny scholar in the sea of knowledge.</i>

I graduated S.B (2019) and M.Eng (2020) from MIT in Computer Science and Molecular Biology. I was advised by [Prof. Peter Szolovits](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/medg/people/psz/home/Pete_MEDG_site/Home.html) in the [CSAIL Clinical Decision Making Group](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/medg/). My [master thesis](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/medg/ftp/pham/PhamMaiPhuong-meng-eecs-2020.pdf) focused on the application of Transformer NLP models on question-answering tasks on clinical reports. I was also a teaching assistant for 6.036 Introduction to Machine Learning (Fall 2019 & Spring 2020). 

I am interested in data science, statistics, and technology. In my free time, I enjoy reading, cooking, and running. My short readings include the Wall Street Journal and the Harvard Business Review. My [reading list](/Lists/#reading-list) contains the books that I have been or am currently reading.
